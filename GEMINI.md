# Gemini Session Context - RentalWeb Project

This file contains context for continuing work on the RentalWeb project.

## Project Overview
- **Goal:** Develop the 'RentalWeb' service, a platform for renting items to student bodies (student councils, clubs).
- **Key Business Logic:** The service is a student welfare initiative, so there are no rental fees.
- **Frontend:** React, Vite, TypeScript.
- **Backend (Decision Pending):** The choice between BaaS (e.g., Supabase) and a custom Monolithic API (e.g., Node.js/NestJS) is pending. The current task is to finalize the requirements specification to inform this decision.

## Current Task
- **Objective:** Collaboratively refine the "Requirements Specification Document" (`Document/요구사항_명세서_v1.0.md`).
- **Current Phase:** Detailing the "Non-functional Requirements" (NFRs).
- **Last Discussed Item:** `NFR-02: 페이지 로드 시간`.
- **Pending User Action:** The user needs to approve the proposed changes for `NFR-02`.
- **Process:** The agent proposes details for each requirement, the user approves/modifies, and the agent updates the document.

## Next Expected Action
- Await user's decision on the proposed changes for `NFR-02: 페이지 로드 시간`.
- Once approved, update the document and proceed to `NFR-03`.

## Key Documents
- `Document/요구사항_명세서_v1.0.md`: The main requirements specification document.
- `Document/architecture/usecase/usecase.pdf`: Contains initial use case definitions.
- `Document/architecture/4차 기획 회의 ...pdf`: Contains initial planning and API ideas.
